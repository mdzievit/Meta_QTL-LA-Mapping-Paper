##**Dissection of leaf angle variation in maize through genetic mapping and meta-analysis**

Matthew J. Dzievit, Xianran Li, Jianming Yu

**All physical positions are in RefGen V3**

The folder "Raw\_Data" contains the raw data files presented in the supplemental data
1. Text file named "leaf\_angle\_QTL\_used\_in\_paper.txt" is the raw file containing information related to LOD, p-value, position, markers, etc. Everything reported in the paper is in this file

2. Text file named "Candidate\_Genes\_Used\_In\_Paper.txt" contains all the information about the candidate genes that was compiled

###Meta-analysis code and files

**In the main folder **

1. The file named "snps\_pvalues_v3.txt" and "Candidate\_Genes\_v3.txt" was used in the R script named "Meta\_Analysis.R". Please refer to the comments within this script for what it does and the files that it writes. All analysis related to the meta-analysis was done with this script and also it generated all figures related to the meta-analysis.

2. There is a markdown file and html document that walks through the code with comments
